nonmem2R v0.1.10 (Release date: 2018-09-26)
==============


Changes:

* Added vpcfig3 for creating multiple VPC plots from one single PSN vpc output file

* Added modload for loading model file and print on screen

* Added stat_QQnorm for Quantile-Quantile plots with ggplot2

* Added stat_QQCL for confidence intervals for Quantile-Quantile plots with ggplot2

* Updated vpgfig2; now using geom_ribbon (instead of geom_polygon) for drawing model confidence intervals.
  This means x-axis limits can be set by e.g. xlim or scale_x_continuous.
  (Previous version using geom_polygon required using coord_cartesian for setting
  axis limits to avoid a corrupted VPC.)



nonmem2R v0.1.9 (Release date: 2018-04-06)
==============

Changes:

* Added model.path argument to vpcfig & vpcfig2, with similar use of model.path as in e.g. sumoR & extload

* Add footnote extToTable to keep track if OMEGA and SIGMA are reported as variances or as standard-deviations

* Updated covload to handle cov files with multiple tables from NONMEM model files with multiple $COV and/or multiple $EST.

* Fixed column names for covload output

* Updated help-page for vpcfig2 with advice for setting axis limits
